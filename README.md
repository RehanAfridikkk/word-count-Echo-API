# word-count-Echo-API
here we are counting the no of Words/vowels/punctuations/lines/time-coplexcity through an API call (Echo Web-FrameWork)
It just uses a Post request to get the "FilePath" and "No-of-Routines" and returns the total-count,total-routines and time taken
to see the "pkg/count.go" file for the conditions of counts 
for reference I have provided a commented code in the "word-count-API-echo.go" uncomment it and it shows how a simple get and post request work
